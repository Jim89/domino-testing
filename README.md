# Domino Testing

## Overview

I had two exercises to work on: 

* First, create a simple classifier with the Natural Language Tool Kit (`nltk`) in `Python` and deploy and API endpoint on the Domino platform to use that classifier for some simple text classification. 
* Secondly, create a Launcher on the platform that used let's a user upload a text file of numbers (one per line). The launcher uses `R` (and the `knitr` package) to create a simple `HTML` report with some summary statistics and a histogram of the numbers.

Testing out the Domino platform has been great. It works really nicely and I was able to easily create two simple examples of things I can imagine using a lot. End-to-end these two exercises probably took only 2.5 hours to put together, starting from scratch and with no experience using Domino before. Writing this summary brings the total to about 3.5 hours. 

A great product with fantastic functionality, and straightforward to use, too. I think my ease-of-use experiences are a testament to both the platform (the functionality seems pretty intuitive) as well as the very helpful [documentation](http://support.dominodatalab.com/hc/en-us). 

As well as saving everything in a simple, public project on the Domino platform [here](https://trial.dominodatalab.com/u/Jim89/domino-testing/overview) I also created a small `GitHub` repository with my code in which lives [here](https://github.com/Jim89/domino-testing).

You can find more details in write-up.md, and check out the code in the two subfolders.
