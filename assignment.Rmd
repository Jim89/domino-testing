## Basic stats launcher

1. Launchers -> New launcher
2. Create example launcher
3. Create first test launcher with basic script - works, but dones't generate output
4. Switch to Rmd file for script - works but doesn't accept parameters so can't pass it the file
5. Use script to read in data then run render to create HTML file which works because the data exists in the same environment (horrible hack but works for now)
6. Tidy up Rmd file to produce neat output in HTML

Total time: 45 minutes
